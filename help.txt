[ Description ]

This program includes a main executable, pmanager, that is a custom shell for
executing external commands. Each command is compiled to a separate binary,
making possible to extend the custom shell's functionality with relative ease.
IPC communication is accomplished using a single shared FIFO, whose
functionality is implemented in the library provided by "message.h".
Test mode uses "test.sh" to populate a file with random commands. Please check
the Makefile for editing arguments passed to this script.
To build the project using -g option, you can pass DEBUG=1 to make.

clean   deletes the "build" and "assets" directories
build   runs "clean" and builds the project, placing binaries under the
        "build" directory
run     runs "build" and executes pmanager
assets  runs "build" and creates test file (using "test.sh") under "assets"
        directory
